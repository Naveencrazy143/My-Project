                            <p> ZENYLOG retains your data, and personal information as per applicable laws for as long as necessary for the purposes described above. This means that we retain different categories of data for different periods of time depending on the type of data, the category of user to whom the data relates, and the purposes for which we collected the data.</p>
                            <p> However, users may request deletion of their account at any time through the help section or mail option in the ZENYLOG, or through ZENYLOG’s website.</p>
                            <p> Following an account deletion request, ZENYLOG deletes the user’s account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute. Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to Independent Partners, this generally means that we retain their account and data for a minimum of 5 years after a deletion request.</p>
